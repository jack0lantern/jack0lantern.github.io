1. What did you do this past week?
The better part of my week I spent cramming for exams and crunching out a network security project. I honestly haven't been applying to enough jobs, though I did apply to some this past week. The week of career fair I applied to several dozen jobs and talked to as many recruiters as I could, and at the end of these efforts I only landed one interview, of which I did and got rejected thereafter. I thought I had done a solid interview and had a decently decorated resume, and upon sharing my sheer discouragement (among other issues, as I have a lot of them) with many of my friends, I received a tremendous amount of support. As cliche as it sounds, sometimes you need someone else to believe in you before you can believe in yourself. Some people might perceive that as weakness. But if to be human is to be weak, then I don't think I should mind it too much.

2. What's in your way?

3. What will you do next week?
The key to completing projects thoroughly and comfortably is not to start early, but to cram early. I'm intent on rolling out at least the majority of project 3 by the end of this coming week. Before that, though, I may have to get to know some new people since I don't have six people I prefer to be in a team with. That's alright, though, I actually really enjoy meeting new people and working with them.

Class experience: 
I've been starting to get the hang of python's iterator patterns after much of Downing beating them into my head. Test 1 was surprising predictable. It was almost disappointing... Almost. The fact that python is such an expressive language also contributed to the ease of the test.

Tip of the week: Watch the presidential debate. Then, get back to work on that project you're supposed to complete. Or more interview prep problems.
